SCP-1730 was a large complex of structures 15km northwest of the US/Mexico border within Big Bend Ranch State Park that was discovered on June 5th, ████. Due to the isolated nature of the complex, and the low survival rate of individuals who come in contact with it, it is possible that SCP-1730 had been previously discovered but unreported.
SCP-1730 bore identifying markings and contained documents to support the claim that SCP-1730 was at one point Foundation Site-13, originally located near Nome, Alaska. This conflicted with extant records, which showed that Site-13 was a project that, while intended to be constructed in Alaska, was scrapped for the larger and more advanced Site-19 and was never completed. Flora located on-site was identified as native to the Alaskan region. How SCP-1730 came to be at its location prior to neutralization is unknown.
SCP-1730 was, upon discovery, in a severe state of disrepair, and appeared to have been left abandoned for an extended period of time. The site power generator had continued to operate in a damaged state, despite a number of fuel leaks and fires throughout the facility. This resulted in intermittent power failures throughout the site, hindering exploration and rescue 
It is confirmed that the 2nd through 15th basement levels were utilized for entity containment, though the state of that containment had deteriorated significantly.
It was believed that a contingent of human survivors existed somewhere deep in the lower basement levels of the facility. Messages written in English were discovered throughout the site, consisting of warnings such as "danger" and "death here", and other messages such as "not my body" and "bleed". A recurring message, "What happened to Site-13?", was found in several different locations in the basements.
